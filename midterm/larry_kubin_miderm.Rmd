## The tidyverse packages

### 1. Can you name which package is associated with each task below?

#### Plotting

ggplot2

#### Data munging/wrangling

dplyr

#### Reshaping (speading and gathering) data

tidyr

#### Importing/exporting data

readr

### 2. Now can you name two functions that you’ve used from each package that you listed above for these tasks?

#### Plotting

ggplot(), aes()

#### Data munging/wrangling

select(), filter()

#### Reshaping data

gather(), spread()

#### Importing/exporting data (note that readRDS and saveRDS are base R functions)

read_csv(), read_delim()

## R Basics

### 1. Fix this code with the fewest number of changes possible so it works:

The exclamation point was not a valid character in a variable name. A variable name can only consist of letters, numbers, and the dot and and underscore characters.

```{r}
My_data.name___is.too00ooLong <- c( 1 , 2 , 3 )
```

### 2. Fix this code so it works:

One of the values was missing a quotation mark. Also, vectors are created using the c() function. There was a capital C used to create the function, which caused an error.

```{r}
my_string <- c('has', 'an', 'error', 'in', 'it')
```

### 3. Look at the code below and comment on what happened to the values in the vector.

A vector can not have multiple types. Since a string is the most complex type in the vector, all values in the vector are coerced to strings.

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1, 2, '3', '4', 5)
my_vector
```

## Data Import / Export

### Import rail_trail.txt

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

rail_trail <- read_delim("rail_trail.txt", "|")
glimpse(rail_trail)
```


### Export the file into an R-specific format and reload it.

```{r}
saveRDS(rail_trail, file = "rail_trail.rds")

rail_trail_rds = readRDS(file = "rail_trail.rds")

glimpse(rail_trail_rds)
```

## Visualization

### 1. Critique this graphic: give only three examples of what is wrong with this graphic. Be concise.

#### 1. The size of the circles is not proportional to the percentage. The area of the 79 percent circle is much more than 5x the size of the 16 percent circle.

#### 2. Side-by-side circles do not clearly express percentage data. This could have been easily expressed by a table or a stacked bar chart.

#### 3. The numbers should have a percentage sign next to them. Without it, they look like quantity/counts at first glance.

### 2. Reproduce this graphic using the diamonds data set.

```{r}

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = reorder(cut, carat), y = carat)) + geom_boxplot() + xlab("CARAT OF DIAMOND") + ylab("CUT OF DIAMOND") + coord_flip()
```

### 3. The previous graphic is not very useful. We can make it much more useful by changing one thing about it. Make the change and plot it again.

```{r}

ggplot(data = diamonds, mapping = aes(x = reorder(cut, carat), y = carat), position="dodge") + geom_boxplot() + xlab("CARAT OF DIAMOND") + ylab("CUT OF DIAMOND") + coord_flip()
```

## Data munging and wrangling (6 points)

#### 1. Is this data “tidy”? If yes, leave it alone and go to the next problem. If no, make it tidy. Note: this data set is called table2 and is available in the tidyverse package. It should be ready for you to use after you’ve loaded the tidyverse package.

The data is not tidy. Cases and population need to be there own columns with only their own values. This can be accomplished using the spread() function.

```{r}
spread(table2, type, count)
```

#### 2. Create a new column in the diamonds data set called price_per_carat that shows the price of each diamond per carat (hint: divide). Only show me the code, not the output.

```{r}
diamonds$price_per_carat <- diamonds$price / diamonds$carat
```

#### 3. For each cut of diamond in the diamonds data set, how many diamonds, and what proportion, have a price > 10000 and a carat < 1.5? There are several ways to get to an answer, but your solution must use the data wrangling verbs from the tidyverse in order to get credit.

##### a. Do the results make sense? Why?

834 diamonds and 1.5%

```{r}

nrow(filter(diamonds, price > 10000 & carat < 1.5))
(nrow(filter(diamonds, price > 10000 & carat < 1.5)) / nrow(diamonds)) * 100
```

##### b. Do we need to be wary of any of these numbers? Why?

```{r}
filter(diamonds, price > 10000 & carat < 1.5)
```

## EDA

Take a look at the txhousing data set that is included with the ggplot2 package and answer these questions:

```{r}
glimpse(txhousing)
```

#### 1. During what time period is this data from?

The time period is January 2000 through July 2015.

```{r}
# get min month for min year
min(txhousing$year)
min_year_houses <- filter(txhousing, year == 2000)
min(min_year_houses$month);

# get max month for max year
max(txhousing$year)
max_year_houses <- filter(txhousing, year == 2015)
max(max_year_houses$month);
```

#### 2. How many cities are represented?

There are 46 distinct cities represented.

```{r}
distinct(txhousing, city)
```

#### 3. Which city, month and year had the highest number of sales?

Houston had the greatest number of sales in July of 2015.

```{r}
ordered <- arrange(txhousing, desc(sales))
print(ordered)
```

#### 4. What kind of relationship do you think exists between the number of listings and the number of sales? Check your assumption and show your work.

If there are more listings there should be more sales. We can see this is the case by creating a simple scatterplot of listings vs. sales. You can see as the number of listings goes up on the X axis, the number of sales trends upwards on the Y axis.


```{r}
ggplot(txhousing, aes(x=listings, y=sales)) + geom_point()
```

#### 5. What proportion of sales is missing for each city?

```{r}
filter(txhousing, is.na(sales)) %>% count(city)
```

#### 6. Looking at only the cities and months with greater than 500 sales:

##### a. Are the distributions of the median sales price (column name median), when grouped by city, different? The same? Show your work.

```{r}
salesgt500 <- filter(txhousing, sales > 500)
saleslt500 <- filter(txhousing, sales < 500)

ggplot(salesgt500, aes(x=median, y=city)) + geom_point()

ggplot(saleslt500, aes(x=median, y=city)) + geom_point()
```

##### b. Any cities that stand out that you’d want to investigate further?

Collin County has only 2 datapoints.

##### c. Why might we want to filter out all cities and months with sales less than 500?

These cities have less data points and would be less accurate.
